## Objectives
This Final Degree Thesis focuses on a preliminary synthesis of algebraic topology, addressing the following key areas:

1. Computing trivial zeros in the table of homotopy groups using the Cell Approximation Theorem.
2. Studying the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem to understand the equalities in the diagonals of the table of homotopy groups.
3. Demonstrating that \(\pi_n(S^n) = Z \ \forall n \in \mathbb{N}\).
4. Analyzing the long exact sequence of homotopy groups provided by a topological fibration.
5. Investigating the Hopf fibration to prove that \(\pi_3(S^2) = Z\) and the equality of the homotopy groups of \(S^2\) and \(S^3\) from \(\pi_3\).

The thesis provides a compendium of essential theorems, definitions, and proofs in algebraic topology, with a practical and concise approach, omitting supplementary explanatory content.
